After a month of fasting in the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims around the world (including me! :)) celebrate Eid al-Fitr which means the celebration of the end of fasting. Hence, I would like to wish all Muslims:

> Eid Mubarak!
> 
> تَقَبَّلَ اللَّهُ مِنَّا وَمِنْك
> 
> May Alloh accept it (all the good deed) from us and you\[1\].

Keep the level of ibadah(observance) high after Ramadan! \*a reminder for myself as well

And I hope we'll have meet Ramadan again next year! \*ameeen :)
