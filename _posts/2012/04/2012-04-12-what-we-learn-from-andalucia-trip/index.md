Well, it has been more than a week since my last post. I was away on Andalucia trip, visiting Sevilla, Granada, Cordoba and Malaga. And here are some highlight of the trip:

**Awesome Alhambra is Awesome!**

Yes2, Alhambra in Granada is cool! Among the castles in Sevilla, Cordoba, and Malaga, Alhambra is simply the best! It has the most sophisticated architecture and Generalife garden is awesome as well. If you want to visit it, book your ticket early so you do not need to queue in the morning. You will be allocated morning time or afternoon time (each around 5 hours) and optimized your time to take cool picture or simply to enjoy the beauty of Alhambra and Generalife.

And don't forget! After conquering Alhambra, it is best to catch sunset in Mirador San Nicholas to enjoy panoramic view of Alhambra!

**One day is enough in Cordoba**

Well, the highlights of Cordoba are Mezquita, cool Roman Bridge, and good panoramic view from Torre de Calahora. And to conquer them all one day from morning to evening is enough.

**Head to Granada's Albayzin to have sneak preview of Morroco!**

Yup, Albayzin is like modern version of medina (old town) of Morocco. Small road, hilly and it's kind of maze! I did not take many pics of Albayzin but I hope these pics can give you some insight. :)

Well I think that's enough for today, I'll try to play around with Wordpress photo sharing feature if I have time :p. Now I need to go back to my homework.. :)
