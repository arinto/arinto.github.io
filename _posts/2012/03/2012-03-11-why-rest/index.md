Last week, I have another assignment of Execution Environment of Distributed Computing course to create an [elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) about REST. More specifically, it is a short presentation (only 5 minutes) to convince your audience to use [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) instead of [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP).

I highlight three important advantages of using REST which are...

1. REST is lighter. It consumes less bandwidth than SOAP
2. Accessing resource in REST is easier compared to SOAP. It is more simpler and intuitive.
3. The absences of SOAP's envelope in REST increases the security of REST. Security gateway or firewall spends less resource to inspect REST query and perform security check on it.

And, as usual, here is my slide: http://www.slideshare.net/arinto/why-use-rest-architecture-for-web-services
