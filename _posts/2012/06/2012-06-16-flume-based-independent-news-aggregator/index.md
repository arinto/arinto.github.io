It has been more than two weeks since my last post! :( I was busy with exam, project reports and my trip preparation. Finally, I manage to find time (on my journey from Warsaw to Prague) to update my blog :p

Well, I would like to cover our SDS project titled "Flume-based Independent News Aggregator" but my project-mate, Mario, has covered as well in his blog. So in this case, I'll just give you the link to Mario's post, which is [here](http://www.marioalmeida.eu/2012/06/04/flume-based-independent-news-aggregator/).

As a follow up of the project, our professor asked us to experiment with the system with regards to its scalability. It is individual project, and I plan to experiment with Flume scalability in term of number of event it can support. Mario will do something related to its realiability and fault tolerance. I plan to update this blog once I finished the project :)

\*Update: Post about the mini project of Flume Scalability can be found [here](http://www.otnira.com/2012/07/09/flume-event-scalability-analysis/ "Flume Event Scalability Analysis").
