I was looking for some slides template for Decentralized System presentation and I found this awesome slide - to kill evil beast called _Procrastination_!

[Brady Gilchrist](http://www.slideshare.net/Bradygilchrist), the creator of the slide, suggests a technique called _KPP_ which stands for _Know, Plan and Push_. In a nutshell, I summarize the technique as...

- Know - means know your _**goal**_! Ask yourself, what do you really want to _**achieve**_ in your life!
- Plan - as the name suggests, _**plan your way**_ to achieve your goal! The slides have useful tips on planning ;)
- Push - _**DO IT!**_ like the Nike's slogan - Just do it! - yeah, push yourself hard to execute your plan and achieve your goal!

Without further ado, please, enjoy the slide! http://www.slideshare.net/Bradygilchrist/kill-procrastination
