Two weeks ago, I, Mario & Zafar had mini project to crawl last.fm's social graph. We performed Random Walk in the social graph and collected the user data such as age, playcounts and number of playlists. Using the collected data, we estimated the property of last.fm user using simple average and normalized average by the number of friends that user has (node degree). Â The detail of the project can be found in [Mario's post](http://www.marioalmeida.eu/2012/10/31/random-walks-on-lastfm/), and I attached the project slides for easy reference:
